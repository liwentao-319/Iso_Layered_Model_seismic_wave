# Iso_Layered_Model_seismic_wave
# Description
A piece of codes to calucate the seismic response for isotropic layerred model using reflectivity and refrectivity coefficients methods. It also incorporates the module to calculate the synthetic Receiver Functions, which is helpful to RF analysis and waveform fitting.

#Installation
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
